#Arithmetic Table Below (Basic)

4 + 2 #Result = 6, Basic addition
4 - 2 #Result = 2, Basic subtraction
4 * 2 #Result = 8, Basic multiplication
4 / 2 #Result = 2, Basic division
4 % 2 #Result = 0, Remainder after division


#Arithmetic Table below (Shortcuts)

6 += 2 #Result = 8, Addition shortcut
6 -= 2 #Result = 4, Subtraction shortcut
6 *= 2 #Result = 12, Multiplication shortcut
6 /= 2 #Result = 3, Division shortcut
6 %= 2 #Result = 0, RAD (Remainder after division) shortcut

#Comparison Table below

1 == 2 #Result = False, Equal to
1 != 2 #Result = True, Not equal to
1 > 2 #Result = False, Greater than
1 < 2 #Result = True, Less than
1 >= 2 #Result = False, Greater or Equal to
1 <= 2 #Result = True, Less or Equal to
